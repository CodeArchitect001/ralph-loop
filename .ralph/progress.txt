[2026-02-15] Story 1 completed: Implemented JSONL parser with parse_line() and parse_file() functions. Successfully handles corrupted JSON lines (3 and 8) by logging to stderr and continuing. All 6 test cases pass. Used json.JSONDecodeError for error handling and validated required fields.
[2026-02-15] Story 2 completed: Implemented LogAnalyzer class with streaming analysis. Supports add_record() for incremental processing and get_stats() for results. Calculates total_logs, error_count, error_rate%, and p50/p99 latencies per service using sorted() instead of numpy. All 6 test cases pass including edge cases like empty input.
[2026-02-15] Story 3 completed: Implemented HTML report generator with generate_report() function. Creates standalone HTML file with inline CSS (no external dependencies). Includes summary cards for total logs/error rate/P99 and service performance table. Color-codes error rates (<1% green, 1-5% yellow, >5% red). Test command passes successfully.
[2026-02-15] Story 4 completed: Implemented CLI interface using argparse. Supports --input, --output, --window-size, and --verbose flags. Window-size parameter limits analysis to last N logs. Verbose mode shows detailed progress. Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (file not found), 2 (parse error). All test commands pass including error handling.
