[2026-02-15] Story 1 completed: Implemented JSONL parser with parse_line() and parse_file() functions. Successfully handles corrupted JSON lines (3 and 8) by logging to stderr and continuing. All 6 test cases pass. Used json.JSONDecodeError for error handling and validated required fields.
[2026-02-15] Story 2 completed: Implemented LogAnalyzer class with streaming analysis. Supports add_record() for incremental processing and get_stats() for results. Calculates total_logs, error_count, error_rate%, and p50/p99 latencies per service using sorted() instead of numpy. All 6 test cases pass including edge cases like empty input.
